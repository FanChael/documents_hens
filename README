Description:
    1.About movie manager.Because I find in my movie folder, many movies included, so I want to build directory for every movie by its name.So I decide to strtok its name, and use execlp function to run mkdir && mv .
    2.Next I want to do like this for .c file, and I also want to study how to create Makefile for every .c file,thinking .....

Need to prompt:
    I use fork() to create process, then to call execlp() , so can handle cycle.Actually we can use system() function to do, beacause this function will run mkdir or mv with child process.
    Next, we need to finish kinds of function.Like delete the file which is 0 bytes,need to thinking.....

        doc -c/-m/-d  option[path]
